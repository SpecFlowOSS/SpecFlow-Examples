Feature: Searching for books
	As a potential customer
	I want to search for books by a simple phrase
	So that I can easily allocate books by something I remember from them.

The search input is located on the [Home Screen](<BookShop.AcceptanceTests/Features/Displaying Home Screen.feature>)

Background:
	Given the following books
		| Author        | Title                              |
		| Martin Fowler | Analysis Patterns                  |
		| Eric Evans    | Domain Driven Design               |
		| Ted Pattison  | Inside Windows SharePoint Services |
		| Gojko Adzic   | Bridging the Communication Gap     |
