1.2.0 - ???

New features:
- Service wrapper to run SpecRun server as a Windows service (SpecRun.Server.Service.exe).
- Regex-based tag filtering - use the expression tagmatch:some-regex to filter for tags in any test filtering expression. 
  E.g. tagmatch:bug\d+ matches for tags like @bug1234 or @bug456
- Allow execution of test assemblies with .NET 3.5 environment (.NET 2.0 CLR), configurable in the profile
- Allow execution of test assemblies with x86 and x64 platform, configurable in the profile
- Support for process-level isolation (each test thread runs in a separate process)
- Tool integrations (e.g. VS2010, TeamCity) will use the tool-specific profile if they exist (e.g. VS1010.srprofile)
- Allow wildcard filtering (*) for testpath filter, e.g. "testpath:Feature:*interface*"
- Adaptive test scheduler is not blocking until the test statistics are received from the server but start working on tests (in random order)

Bug fixes:
- Tests might be skipped when using parallel execution and test thread affinity
- Invalid test thread affinity configuration causes skipped tests
- When the unit test provider is configured to SpecRun+NUnit or SpecRun+MsTest, the Gherkin steps are not displayed properly in the report
- SpecRun+MsTest specflow unit test provider needs additional listener configuration for proper report output
- Failing tests might not reported in TeamCity
- Tests might not be scheduled properly for multuple threads when affinity is specified

1.1.0 - 2012/08/06

New features:
- Support for SpecFlow 1.9.0

  <specFlow>
    <unitTestProvider name="SpecRun" />
    <plugins>
      <add name="SpecRun" />
    </plugins>
  </specFlow>
- Easier configuration for executing the tests both with SpecRun and MsTest/NUnit: 
  use use SpecRun+NUnit or SpecRun+MsTest unit test provider name:
  <specFlow>
    <unitTestProvider name="SpecRun+NUnit" />
    <plugins>
      <add name="SpecRun" />

1.0.0 - 2012/05/31

New features:
- Licensing: to use SpecRun in commercial projects, you have to purchase seat 
  licenses for each team member (not for the build server). 
  See more details at http://www.specrun.com.

  this case the execution of the entire test suite is delayed by a few seconds 
  and an evaluation message is displayed.
- Feature and scenario description is included in the report
- Support for running NUnit tests. See NUnitSupport.txt for details.

Bug fixes:
- Tests cannot be executed from Visual Studio if the feature or scenario title contains parenthesis

Bug fixes:
- Better control for IIS express (default changed to useShellExecute=false, 
  providing faster automation)
- The current directory is set to the base folder
- File logger creates the directory for the expected log file
- Report generator creates the directory for the expected report file
