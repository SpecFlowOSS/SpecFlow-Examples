Feature: 4 Analytics
The second tab on SpecFlow’s LivingDoc '**Analytics**' gives you an overall **overview of all test execution results**.
The [test result](<LivingDoc.Demo/1 LivingDoc Features/1.2 Viewing your documentation/3 Test Results.feature>) of your features, scenarios and steps are summarized and combined in each chart. 

Additionally you can find **unused step definitions** in the dedicated section. 
You can use this report to find unused code in the automation layer, as it will list the unused bindings from your test assembly/binding assemblies.
Steps appearing under the Unused Step Definitions section are steps that exist in the automation layer but are not used in any feature files.
