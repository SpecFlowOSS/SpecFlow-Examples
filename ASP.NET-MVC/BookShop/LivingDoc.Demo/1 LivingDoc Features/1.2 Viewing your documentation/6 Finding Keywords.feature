The number of scenarios in a project can grow very quickly, so finding the data you are looking for is important. 
SpecFlow+ LivingDoc allows you to find keywords in folder names, tags, titles (features, scenarios, scenario outlines), 
descriptions and steps.

**Finding a keyword in the entire documentation**

To find a keyword within your entire documentation:

**1** -  Enter your keyword in the **Filter** field. As you type, the results are updated in the feature explorer.

**2** -  Folders, features and scenarios containing the keyword in the titles, tags, descriptions or steps are displayed in blue. 
  Node titles displayed in grey do not contain the keyword, but at least one child or parent item is containing the keyword. 
  All other nodes (i.e. with no hits) are hidden in the tree.

**3** - Click on an entry in the tree to display that entry. The keyword is <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">highlighted yellow</span> in the content.
